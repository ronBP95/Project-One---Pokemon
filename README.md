## **About the Project**

<br>

Project Pokemon is the first project that I completed during my time at General Assembly. Our assignment was to build out a game of any type and I instantly envisioned a browser based replica of the hit Pokemon games Red + Blue. 

<br>

Features:

<br>

- Lists all 151 of the original Pokemon
- Can battle, use items, and dialogue has been added for humor.
- Uses original Pokemon sprites, pngs and is displayed inside of a gameboy color container.
- Is currently being hosted on the Sia blockchain. Load times may very heavily.

### **Built With**

<br>

As part of our curriculum at General Assembly we were tasked to use <u>**HTML**</u>, <u>**CSS**</u>, and <u>**Javascript**</u> as they were the first technologies we covered as part of our program. I had very basic experience working with HTML and CSS since it had been covered in elective courses in high school and in my undergraduate course, but learning Javascript was completely new to me.

## **Roadmap**

<br>

Project development has been halted indefinitely but I will list some desired changes as well as takeaways that I've learned in developing this application.

*Desired Changes*:
1. Create the gameboy color in full html/css instead of creating a container inside of a .png of a gameboy
2. Utilize an API to pull pokemon names instead of manually typing out all 151 pokemon names and .pngs
3. Include pokemon beyond the original 151
4. Create a lightweight version of the pokemon avatar that can walk around and encounter pokemon

*Takeaways*:
1. API's were covered almost immediately after this project was completed so it would have been nice to know how to utilize them before creating this. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time with the project and eventually learned the power and usage of APIs.
2. It's great to envision something in your mind and create it and see it to fruition. This project was a great example of that.
